                    <p>&emsp; When expressing an interest in learning something new, I often find that people will begin to plan large projects or set very big goals for themselves. I am also guilty of this myself. However, while this approach seems appealing, and having a big goal/dream to work towards seems nice in theory, this mentality is flawed. It almost sets oneself up for failure. It is ok to keep lofty goals in your mind, but focusing too much on them can mean that you psych yourself out or focus too much on planning a “perfect” strategy without actually beginning the process of learning at all. Instead, the most important thing is to start doing what it is that you want to learn or do.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; A great way to start is to put yourself in a position where you can be exposed to your target language often. For me, this primarily relates to how I learned Japanese (and also how I’m going to begin learning Chinese). I try to consume as much media (songs, shows, games, etc) as possible in my target language(s), even if I don’t quite understand it. By doing this, I can begin introducing my brain to what I want to learn. It’s extremely helpful for me to hear sounds and phonetics, as well as practice my listening skills before I even begin to learn what those sounds mean. It also makes the language seem a bit less unfamiliar starting out.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; This can also be applied to learning programming languages, albeit in a slightly different way. I find it very helpful when learning a new programming language to look at multiple ways people solve one problem. For example, when learning how to use HTML and CSS for this project, I watched a lot of different videos about how people made their own websites or blogs. This way, I can somewhat build a small base of knowledge about what I am trying to build or accomplish. Another fun way to do this is to inspect website pages you come across that you like the design of. It can be pretty cool to see just how people decide to build their stuff.</p>
