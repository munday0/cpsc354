                    <p>&emsp; Growing up, learning how to program was incredibly difficult and frustrating for me. It was difficult for me to grasp all of these new concepts that I had never heard of before, and I felt incredibly out of my depth. In contrast, I was very interested in learning other, primarily spoken, languages. It was hard to put it into perspective at the time, but looking back on it I realize that it was so difficult because I didn't think of programming as learning a new language, even though that's exactly what I was doing.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; Programming and other languages are both means of communication. People can communicate with each other, with computers, and with each other through computers. These are all languages which can help facilitate that. They have their own syntax, their own semantics, and their own quirks and caveats which can be both fascinating and frustrating to learn for learners of all skill levels.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; Another similarity in my opinion is that the first new language - whether for programming or otherwise, is the hardest one to learn. People will argue that there are certain languages that are more difficult to learn than others because of their unfamiliar scripts or syntax, but that's not the point I'm trying to get across. People will struggle with learning different things, and there is no completely “easy” language to learn. The main idea is that the first time you attempt to learn a new language, it's the first time your brain is trying to think in a completely different way than what you're used to. And that's incredibly challenging. Unlearning and relearning all the rules you thought to be true, or even discovering new rules that apply in that new language but not others that you're used to can be very uncomfortable at first. However, the more you learn, the more things you realize you can do with the skills you've learned. It's incredibly rewarding being able to understand something you didn't before.</p>
