                    <p>&emsp; There are various reasons why people would want to learn a new language, programming or otherwise. It could be that there are relatives or friends who speak the language, or that there's a certain application that they want to build. Personal motivations will vary, and as long as they help you to learn, it's a plus. For me personally, my motivations for studying other languages and programming languages are somewhat intertwined. As a result, I'm finding it more and more fun to learn about both topics.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; In terms of learning Japanese (as well as wanting to learn other languages), a big part of my motivation for learning has been wanting to understand and consume media in that language. There are many books that, while they have English translations available, I have heard that the authors' prose in their native language is amazing. I also avidly listen to music in other languages, and it would be awesome to understand the lyrics. Additionally, I want to be able to converse with and understand native speakers. Even seemingly small things like turning on the radio or television and being able to understand what the broadcasters are saying has become a goal of mine. There is so much that I feel I can learn from other people and other cultures, and I believe that trying to learn new languages is a good step towards this bigger goal.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; On the other hand, one of the motivations that I have for learning how to program, and for learning new programming languages, is that I want to bridge the gap between the ideas I have and my lacking technical skills. There are lots of things that I think are interesting and that I want to be able to build. However, as of right now, I'm not confident that I can translate what's in my head into an application. I want to get myself and my base knowledge to a point where even if I don't know how to tackle a problem or bug that I'm facing, I'll be able to use prior knowledge and experience to point myself in the right direction. I want to be able to create freedom for myself so that I can take ideas that I once thought were impossible and bring them to fruition. Whether it's a cool website or video game, or an application that helps make people's lives easier, it's this kind of freedom that is my ultimate goal for learning new programming languages.</p>
